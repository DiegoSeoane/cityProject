                <h2>Mansu Hill Grand Monument</h2>
                <p>The Mansu Hill Grand Monument (Chosŏn'gŭl: 만수대대기념비; Hanja: 萬壽臺大紀念碑) 
                    is a complex of monuments in Pyongyang, North Korea. There are 229 figures in 
                    all, commemorating the history of the revolutionary struggle of the Korean 
                    people, and especially their leaders. The central part of the monument consists 
                    of two 20-meter-tall (66 ft) bronze statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.</p>

                <p>The Ryugyong Hotel (Korean: 류경호텔; sometimes spelled as Ryu-Gyong Hotel), 
                    or Yu-Kyung Hotel, more commonly known outside of North Korea as the "Hotel of 
                    Doom", is an unfinished 105-story, 330-metre-tall (1,080 ft) pyramid-shaped 
                    skyscraper in Pyongyang, North Korea. Its name ("capital of willows") is also 
                    one of the historical names for Pyongyang. The building is also known as the 
                    105 Building, a reference to its number of floors. The building has been 
                    planned as a mixed-use development, which would include a hotel.
                    Construction began in 1987 but was halted in 1992 as North Korea entered a 
                    period of economic crisis after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After 1992, 
                    the building stood topped out, but without any windows or interior fittings. 
                    In 2008, construction resumed, and the exterior was completed in 2011. 
                    The hotel was planned to open in 2012, the centenary of founding leader Kim 
                    Il-sung's birth. A partial opening was announced for 2013, but this was cancelled.
                    In 2018, an LED display was fitted to one side, which is used to show propaganda 
                    animations and film scenes.</p>

                <h2>Arch of Reunification</h2>
                <h3>The Monument to the Three-Point Charter for National Reunification</h3>
                <p>The Arch of Reunification, officially the Monument to the Three-Point 
                    Charter for National Reunification, is a sculptural arch located south
                    of Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It was opened in August 
                    2001 to commemorate Korean reunification proposals put forward by 
                    Kim Il-sung.
                    The concrete arch straddles the multi-laned Reunification Highway 
                    leading from Pyongyang to the DMZ. It consists of two Korean women in 
                    traditional dress (Chosŏn-ot), symbolizing the North and the South, 
                    leaning forward to jointly uphold a sphere bearing a map of a 
                    reunified Korea. The sphere is the emblem of the Three Charters; 
                    the Three Principles of National Reunification; the Plan of 
                    Establishing the Democratic Federal Republic of Korea and the Ten 
                    Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation. The original 
                    plan was to have a 55-metre pillar with three branches to represent 
                    Koreans in the north, the south, and overseas.</p>
